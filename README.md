# Anomaly-and-Perceptron-Study

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook `Anomaly-and-Perceptron-Study.ipynb` for Anomaly-and-Perceptron-Study, which is divided into two parts:

##  Part 1: Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection using:
- **Isolation Forest**
- **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**

##  Part 2: Neural Networks (Simple Perceptron)
Performance evaluation of a basic perceptron on two synthetic datasets:
- **SeaSyn** dataset (linearly separable)
- **RingSyn** dataset (non-linearly separable)
